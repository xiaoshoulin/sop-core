-- | An n-ary product.
--
-- The product is parameterized by a type constructor @f@ and
-- indexed by a type-level list @xs@. The length of the list
-- determines the number of elements in the product, and if the
-- @i@-th element of the list is of type @x@, then the @i@-th
-- element of the product is of type @f x@.
--
-- The constructor names are chosen to resemble the names of the
-- list constructors.
--
-- Two common instantiations of @f@ are the identity functor 'I'
-- and the constant functor 'K'. For 'I', the product becomes a
-- heterogeneous list, where the type-level list describes the
-- types of its components. For @'K' a@, the product becomes a
-- homogeneous list, where the contents of the type-level list are
-- ignored, but its length still specifies the number of elements.
--
-- In the context of the SOP approach to generic programming, an
-- n-ary product describes the structure of the arguments of a
-- single data constructor.
--
-- /Examples:/
--
-- > I 'x'    :* I True  :* Nil  ::  NP I       '[ Char, Bool ]
-- > K 0      :* K 1     :* Nil  ::  NP (K Int) '[ Char, Bool ]

-- This is a suitable generalization of 'foldr'. It takes

-- input list is heterogeneous, the result is also indexed
-- by a type-level list.
